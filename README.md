This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

After cloning the repo run `npm instal`, `npm start`. And your browser will open to `localhost:3000` where you will see the app running.

The app uses Kraken's public api to retrieve and show market depth data for the currency pair XBTUSD.
